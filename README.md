Better code block highlighting with [Prism](http://prismjs.com/index.html) for [Hexo](https://hexo.io), which exposes the full power of Prism with an elegent interface
in markdown.

This is done by providing a custom `before_post_render` that replaces the original backtick code block. This package also includes a tag plugin that is similar to the original `include_code` tag, but works with Prism.

## Demo

All code blocks in [my blog](https://unlimitedcodeworks.xyz) are generated by this plugin. Please go and take a look.
The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Aetf/Aetf.github.io).

## Installation

`npm i -S hexo-prism-plus`

This will install `hexo-prism-plus` and add it as a dependency in your `package.json`.

The default highlight is automatically disabled, so no more change is needed.

Note: this plugin uses server-side rendering combined with client-side hydration, and thus it
ships with its own copy of prismjs. Make sure you disable any other prismjs related config in your
theme.

## Usage

### Backtick Code Block

Just write code using fenced code block syntax as usual. Additional options for Prism can be specified either inline or using a preset defined inside the site config file `_config.yml`.

    ```python preset=mypreset lineno=True line=1-4,7
    # some code
    ```

See [wiki](https://github.com/Aetf/hexo-prism-plus/wiki/Config-Options) for detailed description for config options.

### Tag Plugin

To insert code snippets from file with Prism highlight, use

```
{% includecode /path/to/file [inline options] %}
```

`/path/to/file` is relative to `code_dir` in `_config.yml`.
And inline options have the same format as those used in backtick code blocks.
